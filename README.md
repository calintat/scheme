# scheme

This is a minimal interpreter for Scheme written in Haskell.

It is based on the online tutorial
[Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours).

It implements a decent subset of R<sup>7</sup>RS but please note that it is a work in progress.

## About

Scheme is a functional programming language and one of the two main dialects of Lisp.

It follows a minimalist design philosophy specifying a small standard core with powerful extension tools.

The Scheme language is standardized in the Revised<sup>n</sup> Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme or R<sup>n</sup>RS.
